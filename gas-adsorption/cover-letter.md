## Cover letter

To the Editor,

Our paper represents a significant impact toward enabling optimal gas storage
in porous media. With over 200,000 cumulative papers published between
2003-2013 related to metal organic frameworks (MOFs) according to ISI Web of
Science, research interest in porous media is extremely high. A major driving
force in this interest is the application of MOFs in light vehicle fuel storage.
In 2011 alone, over $175 million was awarded for advanced vehicle R&D. In addition,
the storage and use of hydrogen in light vehicle fuel tanks could help to mitigate
climate change.

Our research provides a strong constraint on what types of porous media are
optimal for gas storage (not constrained to fuel storage applications only but
also carbon capture etc...)

The current version of the submitted paper contains approximately 3,000 words.
We feel that after review by referees and revision the word count will approach
2,000 - 2,500 words with changes either eliminating excess words or moving them
into the supplemental.
